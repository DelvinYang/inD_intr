# inD_intr

Utilities for processing the [inD](https://www.iosb.fraunhofer.de/en/inD-dataset.html) dataset.  
This repository contains simple scripts for loading CSV data, constructing scenarios and
visualizing results.

## Directory structure

- `src/` – reusable modules such as data readers and scenario helpers.
- `scripts/` – executable scripts and examples.
- `data/` – output artifacts generated by the scripts.

## Usage

Install dependencies and run any script with Python 3. Example:

```bash
python scripts/build_dataset.py
```

## Code Style

See [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) for contribution guidelines. All code should be formatted
with `black` and include docstrings explaining the functionality.
